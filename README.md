# Random quote generator

## Context

1/30

This project is part of a personal 30 days fullstack challenge I wanted to do.
Each project is made within a day but I'll probably upgrade some of them once the challenge is over.

## Description

This is a random quote generator, the category of the quote is choosable, made with api-ninjas.
To run this code you'll need an api key from api-ninjas.com and add it in public/env.js and replace "YOUR_NINJA_API_KEY"

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Deployment

This project will soon be deployed to be accessible online
